# PyBer Challenge Mod 5
 Challenge
Overview

The purpose of the project was to analyze ride-sharing trends in rural, urban, and suburban areas using Python and Matplotlib as a tool. Then represent the findings through visualization with pivot charts.

Results

I found that Urban cities were around the highest grossing in regards to fares collected. It also has the most drivers and highest rides per capita. The rural area has shown the highest avg. fare per ride and avg. fare per driver.

Summary 

Rural cities based on the data shows the least amount of total rides ( 125 ) , compared to total rides ( 2375)  through the period. Although the fare per ride ( $34.62)  is the highest and the average per driver  ($55.49); the urban are while they have the most rides (1625) and drivers (2405), the average fare per ride ($24.53) and driver ($16.57) is the lowest. When looking at the visualization is shows peak time  for making the most money is around the end February beginning of March. So if I were to manke any suggestions it would be to the rurual areas. There seems to be an opportunity for drivers just based off the ratio of rides to driver and the avg. fare be driver pay.
